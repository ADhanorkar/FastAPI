# FastAPI allows you to declare additional information and validation for your parameters.
# Additional validation
# We are going to enforce that even though q is optional, whenever it is provided, its
# length doesn't exceed 50 characters.

# But now, having Query(max_length=50) inside of Annotated, we are telling FastAPI that
# we want it to extract this value from the query parameters (this would have been the
# default anyway ðŸ¤·) and that we want to have additional validation for this value (that's
# why we do this, to get the additional validation). ðŸ˜Ž

# FastAPI will now:

# Validate the data making sure that the max length is 50 characters
# Show a clear error for the client when the data is not valid
# Document the parameter in the OpenAPI schema path operation (so it will show up in the
# automatic docs UI)


# Add more validations

# You can also add a parameter min_length

# You can define a regular expression pattern that the parameter should match

# /^fixedquery$/ This specific regular expression pattern checks that the received
# parameter value:

# ^: starts with the following characters, doesn't have characters before.
# fixedquery: has the exact value fixedquery.
# $: ends there, doesn't have any more characters after fixedquery.
